    <h2>Don't use X now (if you're like other perople that's all I will tell you).</h2>
    
<p>probaly the easiest way to explain this with the example of walking-runing. You've to learn to walk first before you learn runing. Walking is the foundation of runing. THe most important thing of learning is foundation. The onlu reasom some people able to solve calculas at the age 7 bacause their parents had teach him the foudation at the age 4 when most people's parents teach abc to their child. Actually talnet more specificly bron talent is a lie but why some people slove calculus in 3 second on the other hand you couldn't able to slove it in 30 minites. Actually this person have doundation of more knowlege than you have. For expample if your foundation of calculus is sigle dot then his foundation of calculus is like a moon being dot - I also knwo that it fells imposiable but it is what it is.</p>

<p>now you've understand the importance of foundation now I'll tell you why you shoundn't use X now. The knowlege or wisdom you will have on X (from elon, bil, mark, alex, ...) is like runing but you don't have the foundation or you lack foundation, without foundation this knowlege (running) will suck. Think it like bluiting a 100 floor hourse but you bluit it wihtout any pilar and ciment.</p>

    
<p>BONUS:
    It's just fine to never rich that level there are so many successfull people who did't rich that level yet but they're succesfull.
    
    a question you will probably asked how I'll bluit foundation?
    - the thing you can do is read more specificly read what you love until you love to read, personally I don't recommed love story at all.
    
    This should take 5 years but some people will achive the level of faling love with reading in 2 years. After that read the 'top non fiction books you should read'.</p>
